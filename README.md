This is a simple AND perceptron taught in Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

Feel free to change the weights and bias in the Python program, and see what happens. 
Note that test_inputs array is given, and correct_outputs array comes directly from perceptron defintion.

I may upload other simple perceptrons in the same repo in near future.
